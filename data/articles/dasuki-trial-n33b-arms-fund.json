  "content": "<p>this is not a movie. this happened in court today.</p><p>an efcc investigator stood in front of a judge and started reading numbers. big numbers. the kind that make you stop and wonder if you heard correctly.</p><p>n33 billion. thirty-three billion naira. money meant to buy weapons while boko haram was tearing through the northeast. money meant to protect nigeria.</p><p>instead, it allegedly funded land purchases, properties in abuja, and dollar transfers to saudi arabia.</p><h2>what actually happened in court</h2><p>michael adarikun, an efcc detective, testified about how n2.2 billion - just a piece of the larger n33 billion - moved from the office of the national security adviser under sambo dasuki.</p><p>the money was supposed to secure state elections. instead, it went to a private company called acacia holdings limited, owned by aminu baba-kusa, a former nnpc official.</p><p>before the money hit? acacia holdings had n27,000 in their account.</p><p>after? hundreds of millions started flowing out.</p><h2>where the money went</h2><p>the investigator read out the transfers one by one:</p><ul><li>n600 million here</li><li>n650 million there</li><li>n750 million to reliance referral hospital</li></ul><p>then it got specific. surgical even.</p><p>n70 million to jubril abdullahi. n50 million to baba-kusa himself. n20 million to ec associates. n2 million to a staff member named suraya maigida.</p><p>n15 million went to ibrahim saleh - the guy allegedly buying properties for baba-kusa. that payment? it was for 'hospitality property nigeria' through zabati bdc limited.</p><p>n250 million withdrawn with the vague label 'miscellaneous customer service.'</p><p>another n2 million to saleh to 'facilitate the retention of a plot of land at wuse 2, abuja.' then n25 million more days later.</p><p>and the land deals. n60 million allegedly paid to an islamic academy - not for education, but as part payment for 3.62 hectares of land in kyami district opposite centenary city along airport road.</p><p>survey fees. beacon processing. stadium layouts. all funded with money meant for weapons.</p><h2>the saudi arabia transfer</h2><p>then there's the foreign transfer. n55.9 million moved to facilitate a $1 million transfer.</p><p>only $630,000 allegedly made it to saudi arabia.</p><p>where did the rest go? nobody said.</p><h2>context</h2><p>this is one of several cases stemming from the arms procurement scandal of 2014-2015. president buhari's audit panel found that approximately $2 billion meant for fighting boko haram was unaccounted for.</p><p>sambo dasuki was the national security adviser from 2012 to 2015. the height of boko haram's terror campaign. when soldiers were dying because they didn't have proper equipment.</p><p>the trial has dragged on for nearly a decade. early on, the sss refused to release dasuki on bail despite multiple court orders. now it's 2026 and we're still hearing testimony about transfers from 2015.</p><h2>what the defense said</h2><p>when the efcc tried to enter baba-kusa's statement into evidence, the defense objected. they claimed it was involuntary, made while he was in an efcc underground cell.</p><p>the prosecution said the statement was made in a public area with his lawyer present.</p><p>the judge ordered a trial-within-a-trial to determine if the statement was voluntary. the case continues on february 24.</p><h2>the bigger picture</h2><p>these numbers were read under oath in open court. sworn testimony about money that was supposed to protect nigeria while boko haram was massacring people in the northeast.</p><p>n33 billion is a lot of money. enough to equip an army. enough to change the course of a war.</p><p>instead, if the allegations are true, it bought land in abuja and facilitated transfers to saudi arabia.</p><p>the trial continues.</p>",
